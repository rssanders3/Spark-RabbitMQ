# RabbitMQ-Receiver

RabbitMQ-Receiver is a library that allows the user to read data with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
from [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Requirements

This library requires Spark 1.4+, Scala 2.10+, RabbitMQ 3.5+

## Using the library

There are two ways of using RabbitMQ-Receiver library:

The first one is to add the next dependency in your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.stratio.receiver</groupId>
  <artifactId>rabbitmq</artifactId>
  <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

The other one is to clone the full repository and build the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/rsanders3/RabbitMQ-Receiver.git
mvn clean install
```

### Build

There are two modules to package with different versions of Spark

- To package it with Spark-1.4:

`mvn clean package -pl com.stratio.receiver:spark-rabbitmq_1.4`

- To package it with Spark-1.5 (default):

`mvn clean package -pl com.stratio.receiver:spark-rabbitmq_1.5`

### Scala API

```
val receiverStream = RabbitMQUtils.createStream(sparkStreamingContext, params)
```

### Java API

```
JavaReceiverInputDStream receiverStream = RabbitMQUtils.createJavaStream(javaSparkStreamingContext, params);
